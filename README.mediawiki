# xTest

**

xTest is a graph-based test framework that is somewhere between novel idea and
reverse-engineering of JUnit and TestNG. The goals of the project are to support
smarter test execution, "massive parrellelisation", and a flexible but well
defined wau to modify the test creation and execution using graph transformations
and algorithms.
